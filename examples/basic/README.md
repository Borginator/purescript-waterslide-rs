# basic example

This example illustrates a basic roundtrip between Purescript client and Rust
server.

You need the `xhr2` package installed via npm for it to run. It can be
installed with `npm i xhr2`.

To run the example, assuming you have Rust and Purescript toolchains installed,
all you need to do is `cargo run`.
