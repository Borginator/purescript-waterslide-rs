## Roadmap

Things I want to add in the coming weeks:

- Parametric types (e.g. `Paginated<T>`, or `Option<T>`)
- End to end tests to ensure JSON representation are compatible between
  serde_json and argonaut
- Move the default `ToPursType` implementations to an opt-out feature
- Better documentation and examples

## Contributing

That would be awesome. There are no particular guidelines for pull requests
(maybe in the future). We adhere to the (Rust Code of Conduct)[].
